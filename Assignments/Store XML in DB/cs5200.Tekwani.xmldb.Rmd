## Part 0: Required Libraries
```{r}
library(XML)
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)
library(knitr)
library("methods")
```

## Part 1: Lucid Chart Schema
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/KkxXhkZ.png")
```

## Part 2: Create SQLite DB
```{r}
dbfile = "catalog.db"
dbcon <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), paste0(dbfile))
```
```{sql connection=dbcon}
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON
```
```{sql connection=dbcon}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Catalog;
```
```{sql connection=dbcon}
CREATE TABLE Catalog( 
  id TEXT NOT NULL,
  author TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  genre TEXT NOT NULL,
  edition TEXT NOT NULL,
  price NUMBER NOT NULL,
  publish_date DATE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

## Part 3: Load XML Data into R Dataframes
```{r}

root <- xmlRoot(result)
numOfBooks <- xmlSize(root)

authorList <- xpathSApply(root, "//author")
titleList <- xpathSApply(root, "//title")
genreList <- xpathSApply(root, "//genre")
editionList <- xpathSApply(root, "//edition")
priceList <- xpathSApply(root, "//price")
dateList <- xpathSApply(root, "//publish_date")
descriptionList <- xpathSApply(root, "//description")


books.df <- data.frame (id = vector (mode = "character", 
                                     length = numOfBooks),
                     author = vector (mode = "character", 
                                         length = numOfBooks),

                     stringsAsFactors = F)


# iterate through xml
for (i in 1:numOfBooks)
{
  aBook <- root[[i]]
  bookAttr <- xmlAttrs(aBook)
  idAttr <- bookAttr[1]
  
  books.df$id[i] <- idAttr
  books.df$author[i] <- xmlValue(authorList[[i]])
  books.df$title[i] <- xmlValue(titleList[[i]])
  books.df$genre[i] <- xmlValue(genreList[[i]])
  
  if (idAttr == "bk211") {
    books.df$edition[i] <- xmlValue(editionList[[1]])
  } else {
    books.df$edition[i] <- ""
  }
  
  books.df$price[i] <- as.numeric ( xmlValue(priceList[[i]]) )
  books.df$publish_date[i] <- xmlValue(dateList[[i]])
  books.df$description[i] <- xmlValue(descriptionList[[i]])

## Part 4: Transform Data and Store Into DB
```{r}
dbWriteTable(dbcon, "Catalog", books.df, overwrite = T)
```
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT * From Catalog;
```

## Part 5: Queries
### What is the number of genres have at least three books?
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT genre) as numOfGenres FROM Catalog WHERE genre IN (Select genre FROM Catalog GROUP BY genre HAVING COUNT(genre) > 3)
```
### What is the most recent year in which a publication was published?
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT substr(publish_date, 1, 4) as YEAR FROM Catalog ORDER BY year DESC LIMIT 2
```
### Find the number of books and average price for each genre.
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT genre, COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS numOfBooks, AVG(price) From Catalog GROUP BY genre
```
### List the title and author of all books that are less than 0.8*AVG or more than 1.2*AVG, where AVG is the average price of all books.
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT title, author From Catalog GROUP BY id HAVING price < (.8 *  AVG(price)) OR price > (1.2 *  AVG(price))
```
